    GUMMI type A The Flexible  couplings type A absorb misalignments and vibrations. Misalignment represents 50% of the causes of bearing breaking, as well as other elements of the machines (seals, gears), which are not designed for bending stressed on the shaft. The GUMMI coupling, being elastic, absorbs misalignments, increasing the useful life of the components. It dampens vibrations and shocks, offering a longer service life on transmission components. The average of the vibrations that are transmitted in a system, from one side of the application to the other is about 70%, an aspect minimized by the absorption capacity of the elastic element. GUMMI couplings are easy to install; replacement is faster because it is a single element. Allows higher alignment tolerances. It has no need to move the parts for its replacement.

    The GUMMI AN pneumatic coupling has been specially designed to protect transmissions and machines from the destructive effects of high torsional moment torque fluctuations, associated with internal combustion machines, reciprocating pumps, compressors, mills etc.
    At present, the GUMMI pneumatic coupling has an outstanding performance in marine installations, thanks to its flexibility and ability to control high torque fluctuations by reducing vibrations, with an unbeatable feature: the degree of flexibility can be varied, 'by modifying the pressure of air', since there is a large hysteresis area between the deflection values ​​of the up and down torques
products.industrialCouplings.line_an.description: >
    It absorbs misalignments, it is simple to install, it notably helps to reduce the noise of any transmission, and it provides excellent electrical insulation. It acts as a shock reducer, taking advantage of the resistance of its rubber chamber; reduces torsional fluctuations, in the same way, the natural hysteresis of its flexible element helps reduce vibrations. Due to its constructive characteristics, it lacks all types of lubrication.

aboutUs.story.title: 'Our story'
aboutUs.story.content: >
    The company began in 1955, with serial works for an important machine and tool factory. In 1962 it began to manufacture speed reducers and penetrated strongly in the rubber market, producing seals and diaphragms for the Industry in general.
    In 1964, during a long promotional trip to the interior of the country, the need was detected to create a national coupling that perfects the qualities offered by those used at that time, where only a European model was marketed under license. After 2 years of hard work, in 1966 the Universal Elastic Whole Band Coupling was born, patented in the National Directorate of Intellectual Property.
    In 1968 GUMMI was created. Through a strategic marketing network throughout the country, the coupling was quickly spread and accepted in all types of industries. The success was resounding, to the point of converting the brand \u0027GUMMI\u0027 as the generic name of the coupling.
    By the 1970s with the Petroleum Industry booming, a key element for drilling equipment was consumed: the Pneumatic Clutches. Companies operating in the country were forced to have a considerable stock due to the delay in delivery times, and to import significant quantities. At that time, under the concept of developing national technology and with the support of YPF, we were invited to a new challenge: to manufacture the Pneumatic Clutches -GUMMI to replace the Fawick (current EATON-Airflex) of the USA (models CB, VC and EB) and start testing on different drilling rigs Oil Well, Ideco, Emsco, Cardwell, etc. After this first stage, the DY-A-FLEX type clutches were also developed for National teams, the Romanian type for UPETROM teams, frontal single-disc and multi-disc pneumatic clutches similar to Twin Disc-Wichita, and other mechanical power transmission components.
    As of the 80s, both the Coupling and the GUMMI Clutch were already consolidated as leaders in the National Market and a stage of expansion to Latin America began, exporting to almost all the countries in the region. In 1990, the first export to the USA was made and to carry it out we completed the line of Pneumatic Clutches –GUMMI, being 100% interchangeable with the models manufactured in that country.
    Since 1999, our exports to the USA have increased exponentially, taking Houston as a strategic marketing base, and from that moment on incorporating a number of certifications that support the already proven performance. From that moment, a stage of globalization of GUMMI products began, reaching unexpected destinations such as Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Siberia, among others.
    Due to the growth of international demand, in 2003 an Industrial Plant of 5000 M2 was acquired. In addition, in recent years new technologies have been incorporated into machinery and innovations have been made in the development of High Torque Elastic and Semi-elastic Couplings to satisfy the needs that the market demands.
